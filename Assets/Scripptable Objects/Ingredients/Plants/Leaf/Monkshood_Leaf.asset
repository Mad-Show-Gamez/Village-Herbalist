  description: "Extremely poisonous, monkshood or woulf's bane, as it i also known.
    \nis a herbaceous perennial that s the new to the mountainous parts of the northern
    hemisphere\nTo demonstrate the darker arts, monkshood in highly toxic As with
    many herbs, there is a great deal in the name monkshood because the tall stem
    bears flowers whose sepals are in the form of a cylindrical helmet, looking not
    unlike a monk's cowl.\nand wolf's bane because the toxins were once extracted
    from the plant and used to kill wolves.\nThe herb has long been associated with
    big dogs, and the classical writer Ovid has it in the davering mouth of three-headed
    Cerberus, guard dog to the gates of hell Aconitum is Greek for dart, because
    the juice was used to poison arrow tips. Napellus, or little turnip', is a reference
    to the shape of its roots\nIn her Modern Herbal (1931). Mrs Grieve goes to great
    pains to describe the considerable agonies of being poisoned with monkshood:
    'tingling and numbness of tongue and mouth and a sensation of ants crawling over
    the body, nausea and vomiting with epigastric pain, laboured breathing, pulse
    irregular and weak, skin cold and clammy, features bloodless, giddiness, staggering,
    mind remains clear' No joking around, then: monkshood is a herb to avoid. It
    can be used as an ingredient to soothe the pains of neuralgia, sciatica, arthritis,
    gout, measles and chronic skin problems, but it is definitely one to leave to
    the professional herbalists"
