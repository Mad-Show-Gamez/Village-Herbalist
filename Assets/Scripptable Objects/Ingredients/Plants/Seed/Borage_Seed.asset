  description: 'said by early herbalists to foster cheerfulness and courage.

    The
    seventeenth-century scholar Robert Burton included borage beneath the engraved
    frontispiece of his classic book The Anatomy of Melancholy (1621), to cheer the
    heart of those black fumes which make it smart''

    You can tell this herb
    was of interest to medicinal herbalists: the clue is in the Latin word officinalis,
    meaning used in medicine from the noun officina, which originally meant ''workshop'',
    then monastic storeroom'' and finally ''pharmacy. And a pharmacist''s herb this
    is indeed it was used to treat lung disease, hence its other name, lungwort (wort
    being Anglo-Saxon for medicinal herb Borage leaves and flowers are rich in potassium
    and calcium, which can purify the blood

    Borage has rough, hairy leaves and
    blue (occasionally white and pink) flowers, beloved of bees. Its year-round colourfulness
    means that gardeners love borage too, although it tends to spread easily, so
    they do have to keep it in line. Borage flowers can often be seen garnishing
    a Pimm''s cocktail

    in the summer The gentle cucumber flavour of both flowers
    and

    leaves makes them good to combine with cucumber in salads. In

    parts
    of the Mediterranean, the leaves are cooked and eaten

    as a vegetable.'
