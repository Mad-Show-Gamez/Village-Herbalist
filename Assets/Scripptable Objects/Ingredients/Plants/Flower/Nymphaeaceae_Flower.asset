  description: 'Water-lilies grow in still or slow moving fresh water, with their
    roots and stout rhizomes in the mud. Leaves and flowers grow up on long stalks,
    most leaves floating on the surface and often

    covering large areas. The
    flowers may float or stand clear of the water. Like the buttercups, the water-lilies
    have flowers with

    many stamens and no specialized pollination mechanisms.'
